## Welcome to TrashP4ndasec Reports

this site is currently extremely experimental and hosted out of https://github.com/trashpandasec/blog/edit/master/README.md while I learn to use GH pages/ Jekyll and Ruby for that matter...
 
I make stickers for the lolz and to help support a hackerspace/meetup in philly. 
This is the link to the meetup: 
<https://www.meetup.com/hackersassembly/>

100% of the profits from swag sales goes to payin for meetup pages, rent, and supplies. You can check out the store here: 
<https://www.redbubble.com/people/TrashPandaSec/>

Don't forget when in doubt...
